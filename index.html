        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I run a small vet clinic in Staryya Darohi a small town for almost 7 years. Every single day as the
            doctor I
            need to manage risks, deal with uncertainty, and be able to absorb animal’s pain and anxieties without
            losing my focus.
            profession also requires from me being approachable, decisive, compassionate, and in
            some way – being a leader, the one who is confident about the standards and stands firm up to hold
            their
            values and beliefs. As a person, I am open-minded, and constantly broadening my horizons, either
            professional or personal. I am a team-player because I believe that in a team of like-minded people,
            we
            can
            achieve bigger and brighter successes. I enjoy my spare time, which I don’t have that much, reading
            or
            doing
            some sports. I also curious about technologies and the way they are developing. I got my second
            degree
            in
            web designing and computer graphics, and this have an important influence in my profession.
            Recently, I
            realized that I need a dosage calculator (calculation of medication dosages). Having a background in
            programming, I was able to develop a simple calculator, meeting my purposes. Therefore, I eager to
            advance
            my skills in web designing, polishing my skills and getting a new one, and combine my two passions –
            technologies and veterinary sciences.
